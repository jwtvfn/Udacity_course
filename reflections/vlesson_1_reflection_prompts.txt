How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it is much better than comparing file one by one, but FC command is no good enough for multiple changes, text editor like notepad ++ (and probably sublime) is more efficient

    
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    There is no need to remind, rewrite code, or keep many files with various of names and remembering what was where. It is also easy to rollback to previous version if new changes made fome side effects or go back few versions back if implementation went into wrong direction. Or custommer decided to  get back to previous requirement.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In auto commit we dont have to worry so much when we forget to make a commit or soemthing is going wrong (e.g. system crash) because we can recover our work as much as auto commit frequency allows. Bad thing in such solution is that we have a lot of tiny commits and it is hard to find the one we are looking for.
    
    With Manual commits we are more vulneralble to unexpected events and data loss related to those and we have to remember about reasonable commiting. Good thing is that we have option to comment and name every commit and if we have good practice in that we can clearly distinguish every commit and find changes that we are interested in.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
