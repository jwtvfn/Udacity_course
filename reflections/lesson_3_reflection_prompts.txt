When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with other people
    To make sure that my work is safe - remote servers are using disk arrays preventing data loss

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    My want to create other branch or there might be some conflicts that needs to be solved.Current work might not be finished and ready to comit yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of a GitHub repository to your GitHub account.
    Clone is a copy of GitHub repository to local machine.
    Branch is a virtual copy within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We have information if we are ahead or behind of HEAD.
    We can update the local state of remote without merging and consider whether we want merge it or not.
    It creates 2 virtual branches locally origin/master and master

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be necessary to share files somewhere (e.g. ftp) or sending via e-mail or other storage.
    Need to prepare package or file and have many copies of files to track versions.
    I thing everything would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You want to to do some experimental thing and don't worry to mess up in master.
    you want to start towork on some new project of project family and keep tracking master branch and be open for updating and cherry picking.
